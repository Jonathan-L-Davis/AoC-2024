# AoC 2024 Solutions!

## How to use this repo?
This code may not work on non linux systems atm purely because the build script is written in bash.<br>
<br>
Read XX as a generic term for the given day for the challenge.<br>
<br>
Assuming you have either clang++ or g++ installed (and bash or some otherwise compatible shell), you can just run ./build.sh from the repo root to build the code.<br>
Each executable is placed into the gen directory with the name day_XX, depending on the day.<br>
Your input files must be copied into the input folder in the following manner (input/XX/input.txt), which get copied into the gen folder along with the executables (you can just rerun the build script to copy them over).<br>
Then you can run the day's solution './gen/day_XX'
<br>
I will elaborate on the utilities as they get more numerous & more fleshed out.<br>
